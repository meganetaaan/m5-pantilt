# Derivative Work Guidelines

This is guidelines for derivative works of Stack-chan.

In order to make it easier for third parties to use Stack-chan's characters we declare the guidelines as below.
If you follow these guidelines, you may use Stack-chan's characters for commercial and non-commercial purposes without permission.

## Scope

### Scope of "Stack-chan"

"Stack-chan" refers to a robot created using only the data in this repository.
Therefore, robots that are modified and redistributed by a third party using our data are not eligible.
The following robots are not eligible:

- The robot with a board other than M5Stack like "Obniz-chan", "Wio-terminal chan" or "Micro:bit-chan"
- The robot that features are added to like bipedal walking

When you redistribute derivative works of these robots, you must get a permission from the creators of the respective works.

### Scope of "derivative work"

The term "derivative work" in the guidelines refers to creations that use the "Stack-chan" character.
For example:

- Photo collections and video works featuring Stack-chan robots
- Cartoons and novels featuring Stack-chan
- Stack-chan acrylic stands or key chains
- Stack-chan plush toys

On the other hand, if you use data from this repository to create something that is not Stack-chan, it is not eligible.
The following usages are not eligible:

- Using firmware source code to control IoT devices
- Integrating servo motor brackets into different types of robots

Since the data is distributed under an [open source license](./LICENSE), please follow the terms of the license.

## Compliance/Prohibitions.

### Add credit notation

Please clearly state the following two points in places where users of your works can see them (at the back of books, product introduction pages, instruction manuals, etc.)

1. Stack-chan is developed and published by meganetaaan
2. The URL of Stack-chan's GitHub repository (https:// github.com/stack-chan/stack-chan) for the reference

Below is the example of acceptable description.

### Be politically/religious/ideological neutral and no attack

Please refrain from publishing second creations that include the following expressions:

1. Intended to harm the ideas or honor of Stack-chan contributors or third parties
2. Excessively supports or demeans a specific political, religious, or ideological belief
3. Antisocial
4. Violates on the rights of third parties

### Appropriate zoning

Please use appropriate zoning for expressions that do not match the "prohibited items" but are highly stimulating, such as sex and violence.

1. Tag the images with `NSFW` or `R-18` (means "restricted under 18 years old", mostly used in Japan)
2. When publishing images on Twitter, etc., set a "content warning" so that users cannot view the images unless they open them with their own will.
