# Changing Stack-chan Settings Using a Web Browser

[日本語](./setting-preferences-web_ja.md)

You can modify Stack-chan's settings from a web browser.
Since it connects using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy), you don't need to set up Wi-Fi in advance.

## Prerequisites

* Your PC or smartphone supports Web Bluetooth API

## Steps

* Start Stack-chan while pressing the C button. For models with a touch panel (Core2, CoreS3), start Stack-chan while touching the panel.
* The settings screen will be displayed on the M5Stack.
